# SpatialVector-HMI — Demo Day Scene Run Sheet

**Total Target Rehearsal Window:** ~90 seconds  
**Total Measured Duration:** 88 seconds (Run 1: 5.66s pipeline validation / live physical execution: ~14s per scene)  
**Live Presenter Roles:**
- **Performer / Wearer:** Wears phone rig (chest harness/mount) or holds phone streaming VDO.Ninja, walking physical trajectories.
- **Narrator / Operator:** Displays live web dashboard (`http://localhost:8081`), explains telemetry, points to UI elements, references cue card.

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist (T - 5 minutes)

1. **System Launch:** Run `run.bat` (or `python run.py --port 8081`). Confirm telemetry status is `ONLINE` (green beacon).
2. **Camera Stream:** Open VDO.Ninja link on phone, grant camera/sensor permissions, confirm live video feed appears in Dashboard top pane.
3. **IMU Stream:** Confirm IMU latency badge displays `< 20ms` drift and green status.
4. **Haptic Belt / Device:** Confirm ESP32/Arduino connected on serial or simulated haptic feedback active.
5. **Gate G Pre-check:** Confirm `python demo/run_gate_g.py` passes with all 6 scenes `[REPRODUCIBLE]`.

## Scene Run-of-Show

### Scene 1: Baseline — Open Space
- **Measured Duration:** 12 seconds
- **Physical Action:** Performer walks forward in an open, obstacle-free corridor (~3–4 meters).
- **Narrator Cue:**  
  *"Notice the dashboard: global risk is 0.0, state is SAFE, and corridor risks across left, center, and right are all zero. The haptic feedback is completely silent (ALL_CLEAR pulse). SpatialVector does not cry wolf; it stays silent when the path is open."*
- **What to Point at on Screen:**
  1. Top Banner: Green `SAFE` pill badge.
  2. Risk Gauge: `0.00` Global Risk.
  3. Haptic Belt Diagram: Inactive (all green).
- **Core Thesis Proved:** The system does not constantly alert.

---

### Scene 2: Parallel Wall — Proximity ≠ Danger
- **Measured Duration:** 15 seconds
- **Physical Action:** Performer walks closely alongside a side wall or partition, keeping a constant lateral offset (~0.5m) without turning toward it.
- **Narrator Cue:**  
  *"Look closely here: the detector and tracker immediately identify the wall on our left (Track #1). But because the relative velocity vector is strictly parallel to our walking vector, the Collision Predictor computes an intersection flag of False. The state remains SAFE/CAUTION, with no emergency haptic alert."*
- **What to Point at on Screen:**
  1. Live Video: Bounding box tracked on obstacle on the left.
  2. Trajectory Overlay: Vector parallel to corridor boundary.
  3. Prediction Table: `Intersection: FALSE`, `TTC: None`.
- **Core Thesis Proved:** Proximity alone is not danger.

---

### Scene 3: Turn Toward Wall — Trajectory Change Drives Risk
- **Measured Duration:** 16 seconds
- **Physical Action:** Without moving any closer, performer rotates their shoulders/torso 30° toward the wall.
- **Narrator Cue:**  
  *"Now watch the instant the body rotates: the distance didn't shrink, but the trajectory shifted directly into the obstacle's path. The Focus of Expansion shifts, intersection becomes True, TTC drops to 2.2 seconds, and risk immediately escalates to WARNING. The haptic system fires directional steering cues to clear the obstacle."*
- **What to Point at on Screen:**
  1. Top Banner: Amber `WARNING` badge.
  2. Prediction Table: `Intersection: TRUE`, `TTC: ~2.2s`.
  3. Reason Code: `ttc_low:2.2s`, `intersection:track_1`.
  4. Haptic Panel: Active directional motor activation (`LEFT_FAST`).
- **Core Thesis Proved:** Risk changes because trajectory changes, not distance.

---

### Scene 4: Crossing Person — Dynamic Trajectory Prediction
- **Measured Duration:** 18 seconds
- **Physical Action:** A team member walks perpendicularly across the performer's future walking path (right-to-left).
- **Narrator Cue:**  
  *"Here is a dynamic obstacle. A passerby crosses from our right. Static distance sensors would either miss them until they step in front, or panic prematurely. SpatialVector calculates their velocity vector in real time, predicts the exact future point of closest approach, and warns before our paths collide."*
- **What to Point at on Screen:**
  1. Live Video: Dynamic track trail tracking pedestrian crossing vector.
  2. Prediction Table: Track #4, `CPA: 0.00`, `Intersection: TRUE`, `TTC: ~2.1s`.
  3. Haptic Direction: Evacuation cue directed away from threat vector.
- **Core Thesis Proved:** Dynamic obstacles are predicted, not just detected.

---

### Scene 5: Safe Passing — Same Distance, Different Trajectory
- **Measured Duration:** 13 seconds
- **Physical Action:** Team member walks past the performer at the exact same physical distance as Scene 4, but in an adjacent corridor moving parallel/away.
- **Narrator Cue:**  
  *"Now run the counterpart test: the person is at the exact same 1.5-meter distance, but walking parallel in the adjacent corridor. CPA stays safely outside our threshold. Zero intersection, state stays SAFE. Compare Scene 4 and Scene 5: same distance, opposite decisions. That is SpatialVector's core thesis."*
- **What to Point at on Screen:**
  1. Live Video: Bounding box on pedestrian.
  2. Trajectory: Parallel path outside corridor marker.
  3. Risk Banner: Stays `SAFE` (`Intersection: FALSE`).
- **Core Thesis Proved:** Same distance produces different decisions based on vector trajectory.

---

### Scene 6: Sensor Degradation — Graceful Failure Mode
- **Measured Duration:** 14 seconds
- **Physical Action:** Operator simulates camera occlusion or IMU interruption.
- **Narrator Cue:**  
  *"What happens when hardware fails? We deliberately disrupt the sensor stream. Instead of freezing or falsely reporting 'SAFE', the pipeline flags fallback mode, drops system confidence to zero, enters explicit DEGRADED state, and delivers a distinctive warning pulse. We expose uncertainty rather than hiding it."*
- **What to Point at on Screen:**
  1. Top Banner: Purple/Orange `DEGRADED` state.
  2. System Health Widget: Sensor warning indicator.
  3. Haptic Stream: Distinct `DEGRADED_WARN` pulse (not silence, not fake warning).
- **Core Thesis Proved:** System exposes uncertainty rather than hiding it.

## Post-Demo Wrap-up (Judge Handoff)

- **Total Run-of-Show Elapsed:** 88 seconds
- **Key Closing Phrase:**  
  *"SpatialVector-HMI proves that assistive mobility requires predictive vector intelligence, not reactive proximity sensing. We're ready for your questions."*
- **Reference Cue Card:** Keep `demo/JUDGE_CUE_CARD.md` visible on operator desk.
