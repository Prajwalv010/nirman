M07 — Collision Prediction: TTC + CPA + Intersection

Pure geometry module. No hardware, no threads, no I/O. No ML.
Input:  ObjectGeometry (M06) + Track (M03) per active track.
Output: Prediction per track — three separate, separately-computed geometric answers.

IMPORTANT: This module answers geometry questions only. It does NOT label anything
as "dangerous." Risk classification is M08's job.

Linear-motion assumption (documented):
  All trajectory extrapolation assumes constant velocity. This is a known limitation
  for the first prototype — pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles are modelled as
  point-masses moving at their current estimated velocity. Non-linear motion (turns,
  acceleration, deceleration) is accepted as out-of-scope for this build.
  Implication: TTC and CPA accuracy degrades in proportion to how non-linear the
  actual motion is. For objects undergoing significant direction changes, treat
  prediction_confidence as an upper bound on reliability.

Three separate questions (never collapse into one number):
  1. CPA  — closest point of approach (distance), regardless of whether paths cross.
             Computed from: cpa_time = -dot(rel_pos, rel_vel) / dot(rel_vel, rel_vel)
             cpa_distance = |rel_pos + rel_vel * cpa_time|
  2. TTC  — time until relative distance crosses the contact threshold.
             Defined only when intersection_flag is True and the contact crossing
             occurs within the configured horizon. Otherwise ttc_s = None.
  3. Intersection — do projected paths actually cross within corridor_width_normalized
             AND within horizon_s AND in the future (cpa_time > 0)?

Config values (from config/default.yaml, section "prediction"):
  horizon_s:                    5.0   — beyond this, treat as "no near-term concern"
  contact_threshold_normalized: 0.05  — "collision" distance in normalized units
  corridor_width_normalized:    0.12  — how wide a corridor is for intersection_flag

Near-zero relative velocity handling:
  When |rel_vel| < _REL_VEL_EPSILON, objects are effectively parallel or co-moving.
  In this case: no TTC (None), intersection_flag = False, cpa = current distance.
  This is NOT treated as an error — it is a valid safe outcome.

Ego-motion note:
  The user is treated as the stationary reference frame. Ego-motion compensation
  (M05) has already been applied upstream in MotionState.corrected_flow; there is
  no second ego-motion subtraction here.
