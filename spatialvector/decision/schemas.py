"""
Decision chain shared data contracts for SpatialVector-HMI.

These schemas define the outputs of M07 (Collision Prediction), M08 (Risk Engine),
and M09 (Corridor Policy / Haptic Policy).

Architectural rules encoded here:
  - Prediction answers geometry questions only. It does NOT say "this is dangerous."
  - RiskState is the single source of truth for warning state. No other module may
    independently decide "this is a WARNING."
  - HapticCommand is the only module output that specifies a motor pattern. M10 is a
    dumb consumer of this struct.

Field names here are final. Do not rename without updating downstream modules.

class Prediction:
    """Output of M07 for one track, one frame.

    Three separately-computed geometric answers:
      ttc_s:                  HOW SOON would paths cross (timing, not probability).
                              None = no finite/relevant TTC — receding, parallel, or beyond horizon.
                              IMPORTANT: TTC is a timing answer, not a collision probability.
                              Do NOT interpret a low TTC as "high probability of collision."
                              intersection_flag and prediction_confidence carry the "how sure are
                              we this matters" information; TTC alone does not.
      cpa_normalized:         Closest Point of Approach distance (normalized geometry units).
                              This is the minimum distance the two trajectories would reach
                              if projected forward, regardless of whether paths literally cross.
      miss_distance_normalized: Perpendicular miss distance when paths don't intersect.
                              Equal to cpa_normalized when intersection_flag is False.
      intersection_flag:      Do projected paths actually cross within the configured horizon?
                              True only if CPA distance is below corridor_width_normalized AND
                              CPA time is positive and within horizon_s.
      prediction_confidence:  0..1 confidence in these values. Derives from geometry_confidence
                              (M06) and trajectory stability. When low, M08 should treat this
                              prediction cautiously.
