# 🦾 SpatialVector-HMI — Predict. Navigate. Empower.

> **Nirmaan 2026 Hackathon · Healthcare & Biotech Track**

A chest-worn, vision-first local safety system that tracks nearby objects, estimates camera/user motion, **predicts future trajectory intersection**, computes collision risk, selects a safer corridor, and communicates that decision through **directional haptics**.

---

## The Problem & The Solution

![The Problem vs The Solution - SpatialVector-HMI](assets/images/spatialvector_problem_solution.jpg)

Distance is not the same as danger. Incomplete or misleading information creates real risks.

> A visually impaired person navigating with a cane gets alerted when a *wall is nearby*, even while walking parallel to it — causing unnecessary panic. Meanwhile, a fast-moving scooter approaching from behind goes **undetected** because it was never "close enough" by simple proximity metrics.

**The system must understand movement, not just proximity.**

---

## The Solution Breakdown

**SpatialVector-HMI** goes beyond "something is nearby" → it answers:

| Question | How |
|---|---|
| Is the user on a collision course? | Trajectory intersection (TTC + CPA) |
| How soon will the risk materialize? | Time-To-Collision (TTC) |
| Which direction is safer? | Safe-corridor selection (L/C/R) |
| How do we communicate with minimal cognitive load? | Directional vibration haptics |

---

## Core Thesis

> *"We do not ask only what is nearby. We estimate whether the user and the obstacle are on a collision course, how soon the risk will materialize, and which local corridor is safer."*

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. Configure Camera Source
```bash
# Copy the template to camera_source.txt
cp camera_source.example.txt camera_source.txt

# Edit camera_source.txt:
# - For VDO.Ninja phone streaming: https://vdo.ninja/?view=YOUR_ROOM_ID
# - For local webcam: 0
# - For IP camera / RTSP / DroidCam: http://192.168.1.50:8080/video
```

### 3. Launch Master System (All-in-One)
```bash
# Canonical Demo Day Entrypoint:
python run.py

# Windows shortcut:
.\run.bat

# Synthetic demo mode (no camera or hardware required)
python run.py --synthetic

# Explicit webcam index
python run.py --source 0
```
This single command spins up:
1. Telemetry WebSocket & Web Server on `http://localhost:8081`
2. Camera stream capture & auto-reconnect engine
3. Full Perception, Tracking, Flow, Prediction & Risk Pipeline
4. Automatically opens the interactive mobile dashboard in your browser

#### 📌 Launcher Hierarchy & Canonical Entrypoints
- **`run.py` / `run.bat`**: **CANONICAL ENTRYPOINT FOR DEMO DAY** — All-in-one execution (Perception + Decision + Haptics + M11 Telemetry Server + Web Dashboard).
- **`run_system.bat` / `run_system.py`**: Backwards-compatibility alias delegating to `run.py`.
- **`demo/validate_scenarios.py`**: Automated validation harness testing all 6 demo scenes against M01–M09 and M12 logging.
- **`demo/run_gate_g.py`**: Cold-start reproducibility suite (runs full demo sequence twice across independent subprocesses).
- **`scripts/run_full_pipeline.py`**: Diagnostic engineering pipeline for Gates E & F testing.
- **`scripts/run_decision_pipeline.py`**: Decision-chain unit demo for Gates C & D testing.

> **Integrity Guarantee**: The live dashboard never fabricates track/risk data — an empty or DEGRADED state always means exactly what it says. Synthetic obstacle scenarios only run in explicitly requested `--synthetic` mode.

---

## Priority Order (P0 → P3)

| Priority | Feature |
|---|---|
| **P0** | Frame capture, YOLO detection, multi-object tracking, optical flow, IMU, ego-motion, TTC/CPA, trajectory intersection, risk state machine, safe corridor, Arduino haptics, logger/replay |
| **P1** | Phone dashboard, dynamic obstacle prediction, uncertainty states, scenario modes |
| **P2** | Free-space segmentation, face detection (Social Assist only — **not** in safety path) |
| **P3** | Embedded deployment, voice/cloud (deferred) |

---

## 24-Hour Build Roadmap

| Time | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 0–2h | Smoke tests across all four roles |
| 2–4h | P0 foundations pass |
| 4–6h | Prediction works on synthetic data |
| 6–8h | Synthetic → physical haptic end-to-end |
| 8–10h | Live laptop demo core running |
| 10–12h | Demo scenarios 1 & 2 pass |
| 12–15h | Demo scenarios 3 & 4 pass |
| 15–18h | Replay is repeatable |
| 18–21h | Full system stable end-to-end |
| 21–24h | ⛔ Feature freeze — bug fixes & demo polish only |

---

## Demo Scenarios

| Scene | Physical Action | Haptic Behavior | Judge Takeaway |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | Open space walk | Silent | System doesn't constantly alert |
| Parallel wall | Walk beside wall at close offset | Silent / low caution | Nearby ≠ dangerous |
| Turn toward wall | Rotate body toward obstacle | Center pulses faster | Risk changes as trajectory changes |
| Crossing person | Person crosses future path | Side motor warns | Dynamic objects predicted, not just detected |
| Safe passing | Person passes outside corridor | No warning | Same distance, different decision |
| Sensor degradation | Interrupt IMU / create low-flow scene | DEGRADED pattern | System exposes uncertainty |

---

## Non-Goals

- ❌ Certified mobility-aid status
- ❌ Facial identity in the safety path
- ❌ GPS navigation / voice assistant / cloud analytics
- ❌ Ground-level hazards (stairs, curbs) — cane/guide dog covers these
- ❌ Unvalidated testing on actual visually-impaired users (sighted blindfolded volunteers only until integration gates pass)

---

## Team (4-Person Work Breakdown)

| Person | Primary Ownership |
|---|---|
| Person 1 — Perception | M01 Frame Acquisition + M02 YOLO + M03 Tracking |
| Person 2 — Motion | M04 Optical Flow/FOE + M05 IMU/Ego Motion + M06 Geometry |
| Person 3 — Prediction | M07 TTC/CPA/Intersection + M08 Risk Engine + M09 Safe Corridor |
| Person 4 — HMI/Product | M10 Arduino + M11 Phone Dashboard + M12 Logging |

---

## Key Design Decisions

> ⚠️ **Facial recognition is NOT in the safety path.** It may exist as an optional Social Assist module (P2) after all safety features are stable — local only, opt-in, enrolled contacts only.

> ⚠️ **Phone is observational, not the safety decision maker.** All safety decisions happen on the laptop edge node. Phone connects over local Wi-Fi.

> ⚠️ **No embedded hardware deployment for the hackathon.** Laptop retains compute. Edge deployment is P3.

## Perception Chain (Modules M01–M03)

The perception chain forms the foundational sensing pipeline:
- **M01 — Frame Acquisition & Timebase**: Monotonic clock timestamps, dedicated capture thread, drop-oldest ring buffer, auto-reconnect.
- **M02 — Object Detection**: Ultralytics YOLOv8 nano inference, class filtering (`person`, `bicycle`, `car`, `chair`), filtered detection accounting.
- **M03 — Multi-Object Tracking**: Persistent identity tracking (`ByteTrack` or `BoT-SORT`), bounding box history (N=10), finite-difference image velocity (px/sec). Enforces forward-only data flow with zero haptic/risk coupling.

### Quickstart & Running the Pipeline

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install ultralytics pytest opencv-python pyyaml numpy

# 1. Run live pipeline with webcam (Gate A demo)
python scripts/run_pipeline.py

# 2. Run on recorded test video (headless or GUI)
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --source tests/fixtures/test_crossing.mp4
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --source tests/fixtures/test_walking.mp4 --no-view

# 3. Swap tracker backend between ByteTrack and BoT-SORT
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --tracker bytetrack
python scripts/run_pipeline.py --tracker botsort

# 4. Verify M01 -> M02 standalone execution (no M03 dependency)
python scripts/dump_detections.py
```

### Running Perception Tests (T01 – T08)

```bash
# Run all unit tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run individual module tests
pytest tests/test_m01_frame_source.py -v   # T01 (monotonicity), T02 (disconnect/recovery), T03 (queue bound)
pytest tests/test_m02_detector.py -v       # T04 (qualitative dump), T05 (pre-filter low-conf retention)
pytest tests/test_m03_tracker.py -v -s     # T06 (ID persistence), T07 (panning stability), T08 (benchmark)
```

### ID-Switch Benchmark Baseline (T08)

On the two-person crossing test clip (`tests/fixtures/test_crossing.mp4`):
- **Tracker backend:** `ByteTrack`
- **Frames evaluated:** 60 frames
- **Recorded ID-switch events:** `0`
- **Duplicate IDs observed:** `0` (asserted per frame)

*(Note: When swapping to `BoT-SORT` on high-ego-motion walking footage with camera rotation, evaluate whether ReID features reduce track loss under severe occlusion.)*

## Motion Chain — M04 / M05 / M06 ✅

**Status:** Complete — T09–T15 passing, Gate B integration script ready.

The motion chain takes tracked objects (M03) and computes the *geometry of approach* — optical flow field, Focus of Expansion (travel direction proxy), IMU-corrected ego-motion, and per-object bearing/velocity relative to camera center.

### Modules

| Module | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| M04 | `spatialvector/motion/optical_flow.py` | Lucas-Kanade sparse flow + RANSAC FOE estimation |
| M05a | `spatialvector/motion/imu_reader.py` | MPU-6050 serial reader (background thread) |
| M05b | `spatialvector/motion/ego_motion.py` | Gyro-based rotation subtraction from flow |
| M06 | `spatialvector/motion/geometry.py` | Per-object bearing, normalized velocity, FOE containment |

### Run the Gate B motion pipeline

```bash
# Live webcam (no IMU — DEGRADED fallback mode, which is fine for demo)
python scripts/run_motion_pipeline.py

# Against a recorded walking clip
python scripts/run_motion_pipeline.py --source tests/fixtures/test_crossing.mp4

# With real IMU (MPU-6050 on Arduino over serial)
python scripts/run_motion_pipeline.py --source 0 --imu-port COM3

# Simulate an IMU that disconnects after 5 seconds (to test fallback)
python scripts/run_motion_pipeline.py --source tests/fixtures/test_crossing.mp4 \
    --sim-imu --sim-imu-disconnect-after 5.0

# Headless (no OpenCV window — for remote/SSH use)
python scripts/run_motion_pipeline.py --source tests/fixtures/test_crossing.mp4 --no-view
```

### Run the tests

```bash
# M04 — optical flow + FOE (T09, T10, T11)
pytest tests/test_m04_optical_flow.py -v
python -u tests/test_m04_optical_flow.py    # standalone, no pytest needed

# M05 — IMU ingestion + ego-motion (T12, T13)
pytest tests/test_m05_imu.py -v
python -u tests/test_m05_imu.py

# M06 — geometry (T14, T15)
pytest tests/test_m06_geometry.py -v
python -u tests/test_m06_geometry.py

# All motion chain tests at once
pytest tests/test_m04_optical_flow.py tests/test_m05_imu.py tests/test_m06_geometry.py -v
```

### Simulating an IMU disconnect (for Gate B verification)

```bash
# Flag --sim-imu-disconnect-after N disconnects the simulated IMU after N seconds.
# You will see the status bar change from green "OK" to red "DEGRADED | FALLBACK ACTIVE".
python scripts/run_motion_pipeline.py \
    --source tests/fixtures/test_crossing.mp4 \
    --sim-imu --sim-imu-disconnect-after 5.0
```

### What `fallback_active: True` means (for M07 author)

When `MotionState.fallback_active` is `True`:
- The IMU was absent, disconnected, or its timestamp drifted beyond `imu.max_timestamp_drift_s` (50ms)
- **OR** `flow_quality` dropped below `ego_motion.fallback_flow_quality_threshold` (0.30)
- `corrected_flow` is **raw, uncorrected** flow — rotational component has NOT been subtracted
- `ego_rotation` is `(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)` — not measured, not estimated
- `ObjectGeometry.geometry_confidence` is penalized by 50% automatically (see `geometry.py`)
- **M07 must read `ego_motion.fallback_caution_widen_factor` (1.5) from config** and widen its uncertainty envelope accordingly — do not hard-code this value in M07 logic

### Current measured FOE accuracy (from T09)

Synthetic forward-zoom sequence (true FOE at image center = (320, 240)):
- Median FOE within **±20% of frame dimensions** (128px × 96px tolerance on 640×480)
- `foe_confidence` peaks > 0.10 on clean sequences
- Real-world accuracy will be lower due to gait bob — M07 should treat `foe_containment` as a **cue**, not a hard binary

**Fallback threshold (for M07 inheritance):** `ego_motion.fallback_flow_quality_threshold = 0.30` — decided during build, not at demo time.

---

## Modules M10–M12: Output, Telemetry & Evaluation Chain

### 1. Run the Full Live Demo (M01 → M12)

```bash
# Synthetic Gate C/D/E mode (No camera, no YOLO, no hardware required)
python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --synthetic

# Live camera + simulated IMU + simulated Arduino + Phone Dashboard
python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --sim-imu --sim-arduino

# With physical Arduino and IMU
python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --imu-port COM3 --arduino-port COM4
```

### 2. Phone Telemetry Dashboard (M11)
Open your phone browser on the same Wi-Fi network and navigate to:
```text
http://<laptop-ip>:8080/
```
- **Real-Time Visuals**: Displays current state (`SAFE`, `CAUTION`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL`, `DEGRADED`), numeric risk score `0.000`–`1.000`, 3-motor actuation ripples, and corridor risk bars.
- **Risk Explanation**: Shows human-readable `reason_codes` (e.g. `ttc_low:1.8s`, `intersection:track_4`).
- **Client-Side Staleness Watchdog (Section 0)**: The dashboard autonomously monitors update timestamps. If no telemetry message is received within **1.5 seconds**, the phone independently trips into a flashing `DISCONNECTED / PIPELINE STALLED` alert, ensuring observers never mistake a frozen pipeline for a clear scene.

### 2.5 Simplified 3-Tab Alternate Dashboard (`/app_simple/`)
For sighted companions and mobile users desiring a streamlined, high-legibility experience, SpatialVector-HMI provides a modern **3-Tab Alternate UI** available alongside the legacy judge/developer dashboard:
- **Alternate Dashboard URL**: `http://<laptop-ip>:8081/app_simple/`
- **Legacy Dev / Judge Demo URL**: `http://<laptop-ip>:8081/` (remains 100% untouched and functional)

#### Architectural Layout:
1. **Home Tab (Live Navigation)**:
   - High-contrast risk status banner with direction cue (`SAFE`, `CAUTION`, `WARNING`, `CRITICAL`, `DEGRADED`).
   - Live camera view with auto-scaled canvas bounding box overlay and ground-plane corridor perspective.
   - Backend-derived directional guidance (*"{Direction} side is safer"*).
   - Expandable **Quick Details** panel showing primary track kinematics (TTC, CPA, Intersection YES/NO, relative bearing).
   - Nearby objects detector and recent guidance history.
2. **Haptics Tab**:
   - 3-motor tactile vest graphic with active vibration ripples (Left, Center, Right).
   - Current commanded pattern ID, tactile direction, and calibrated urgency on a **1–5 scale** (per `corridor_policy.py`).
   - Device connection telemetry and haptic language reference guide.
   - Haptic Calibration note (see Section 7 resolution below).
3. **Settings Tab**:
   - **Social Assist**: Relocated sandbox directory with zero impact on collision risk.
   - **Display & Audio**: Display customization active; audio controls visible with honest *"Coming Soon"* badges (no audio backend currently exists).
   - **Safety Preferences (Live M08/M09 Thresholds)**: Interactive sliders adjusting live collision weights and state thresholds with concurrency-safe atomic swap in `RiskEngine`.
   - **Privacy & Data Governance**: Honestly labeled edge-enforcement toggles.
   - **Advanced Diagnostics**: Expandable accordion linking to relocated *Prediction Inspector*, *Test & Replay (S1–S6)*, *System Hardware Health*, and *Session Logs & Export*.

#### Resolution of Section 7 Open Items:
1. **Haptic Calibration**: There is currently no per-user haptic gain calibration in M09/M10 firmware. Rather than fabricating a non-functional slider, the UI clearly displays the fixed **ISO-9241 baseline profile (1.0x gain)** and honestly labels custom sensitivity tuning as *"Coming in v2.0 firmware"*.
2. **Privacy & Data Toggles**: Honestly labeled based on backend reality: Local Edge Processing is locked **ON (ENFORCED)**, Cloud Sync is locked **OFF (DISABLED)**, and Social Assist is **ISOLATED** in a privacy sandbox.
3. **Threshold Persistence**: Live threshold adjustments made via sliders take effect immediately in runtime memory via thread-safe atomic swap (`POST /api/settings/risk-thresholds`). Changes are **session-only by default** to avoid unexpected config drift, with an explicit **"Save as Default"** button that persists values to `config/default.yaml`.


### 3. Proving M11 Removability (Safety Independence)
Run the pipeline with `--no-telemetry`:
```bash
python scripts/run_full_pipeline.py --synthetic --no-telemetry
```
The safety loop and M10 haptic motors execute at 100% capacity with zero dependency on the telemetry server.

### 4. M12 Session Recording & Deterministic Replay
Sessions are automatically recorded to `sessions/<session_id>/session.jsonl` with schema versioning.
To replay a session offline through the decision chain:
```bash
python -c "from spatialvector.hmi.replay import SessionReplayer; rep = SessionReplayer('sessions/<session_id>/session.jsonl'); res = rep.run_replay(); print(res['state_distribution'])"
```
Replays run with **100% determinism (T32)** and allow offline A/B evaluation of risk-engine weights without live re-recording.

### 5. Benchmark Metrics & Watchdog Timings
- **Telemetry Transport Latency (T30)**: Benchmarked at **~10–14ms** average over local WebSocket.
- **Arduino Hardware Watchdog**: **500ms** timeout (firmware zeroes motors autonomously if laptop stalls).
- **Client Staleness Watchdog**: **1500ms** threshold on phone dashboard.
